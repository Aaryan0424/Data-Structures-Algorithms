# Longest Bitonic Subarray
You are given an array of positive integers as input. Write a code to return the length of the largest such sub-array in which the values are arranged first in strictly ascending order and then in strictly descending order.
Such a sub-array is known as bitonic sub-array. A purely increasing or purely decreasing subsequence will also be considered as a bitonic sequence with the other part empty.
