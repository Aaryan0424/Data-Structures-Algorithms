# Funny String
Our task is to check if the word is funny or not.

***What is a funny word?***

Reverse the given string. Iterate through each character of that string, compare the absolute difference in the ASCII values of the characters at positions 0 and 1, 1 and 2, 2 and 3 and so on to the end. If the list of absolute differences is the same for both strings, they are funny otherwise not.
