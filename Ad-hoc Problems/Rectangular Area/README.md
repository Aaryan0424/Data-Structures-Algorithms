# Rectangular Area
You are given N rectangles, which are centered in the center of the Cartesian coordinate system and their sides are parallel to the coordinate axes. Each rectangle is uniquely identified with its width (along x-axis) and height (along y-axis). Batman has colored each rectangle in a certain color and now wants to know the area of the colored region of the paper.
### Input Format
```
    The first line of the input contains the integer N (1<=N<=1000000), the number of rectangles.
    Each of the following N lines contains even integers X and Y (2 <= X, Y <= 10^7), dimensions(width and height resp.) for the corresponding rectangles.
```
### Output Format
```
    Output the area of the colored region.
