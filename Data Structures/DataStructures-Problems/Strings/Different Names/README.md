# Different Names
In Little Flowers Public School, there are many students with same first names. You are given a task to find the students with same names. You will be given a string comprising of all the names of students and you have to tell the name and count of those students having same. If all the names are unique, print -1 instead.
Note: We don't have to mention names whose frequency is 1.
