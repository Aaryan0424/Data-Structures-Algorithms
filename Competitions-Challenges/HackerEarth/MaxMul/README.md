# MaxMul
Given an array **A** of size **N**, find the maximum possible product of two numbers.
### Input
The first line contains an integer **T**, the number of test cases. Each case is described by two lines each. The first line of each test case will contain an integer **N**, the size of the array. The next line will contain **N** integers representing the array.
### Output
For each test case, print the desired result.
### Constraints
```
    1 <= T <= 10
    1 <= N <= 10^5
    -10^5 <= A[i] <= 10^5
```
### Sample Input
```
    2
    5
    2 3 0 1 5
    5
    -3 0 2 6 1
```
### Sample Output
```
    15
    12
```
### Explanation
In the first case, **3 \* 5 = 15** is the maximum
In the second case, **2 \* 6 = 12** is the maximum
