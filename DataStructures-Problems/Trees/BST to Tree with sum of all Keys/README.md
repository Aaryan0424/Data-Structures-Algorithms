# BST to a Tree with sum of all smaller keys

Given a Binary Search Tree(BST), convert it to a Binary Tree such that every key of the original BST is changed to key plus sum of all smaller keys in BST.

Given a BST with N Nodes we have to convert into Binary Tree

### Tree:


```
             9
           /   \
          6     15
        /         \
       3           21
```
Given above BST with N=5 Nodes. The values at Node being 9, 6, 15, 3, 21

Binary Tree after convertion

```
            18
           /   \
          9     33
        /         \
       3           54
```
Binary Tree after convertion, the values at Node being 18, 9, 33, 3, 54
