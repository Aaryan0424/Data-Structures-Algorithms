# Print all the paths from root, with a specified sum in Binary tree

Given a Binary tree and a sum S, print all the paths, starting from root, that sums upto the given sum.

Note that this problem is different from root to leaf paths. Here path doesnâ€™t need to end on a leaf node.

### Examples:


```
    Input : sum = 8,
            Root of tree
             1
           /   \
         20      3
               /    \
             4       15    
            /  \     /  \
           6    7   8    9     
    Output :
        Path: 1 3 4
```
