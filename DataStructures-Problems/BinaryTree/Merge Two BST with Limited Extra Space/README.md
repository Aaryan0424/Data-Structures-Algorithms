# Merge Two BSTs with Limited Extra Space

Given two Binary Search Trees(BST), print the elements of both BSTs in sorted form. The expected time complexity is O(m+n) where m is the number of nodes in first tree and n is the number of nodes in second tree. Maximum allowed auxiliary space is O(height of the first tree + height of the second tree).

### Sample Tree
```
    Tree_1:
             3
            / \
           1   5
    Tree_2:
             4
            / \
           2   6

    Output:
        1 2 3 4 5 6
```
