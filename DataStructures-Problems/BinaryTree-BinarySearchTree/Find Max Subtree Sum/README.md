# Find largest subtree sum in a tree

Given a binary tree, task is to find subtree with maximum sum in tree.

### Examples:


```
Input :       1
            /    \
          -2      3
          / \    /  \
         4   5  -6   2
Output : 7
Subtree with largest sum is :  -2
                              /  \
                             4    5
Also, entire tree sum is also 7.
