# TRIANGLE OF STARS
Rohan went to park one day and his uncle gave him a tricky way of display stars and asked him to print a Triange of stars, one star in the first row, three on the second . . . for 12 rows.Write a main() program that prints a triangle of stars. Print 1 star in row 0, 3 stars in row 1, 5 stars in row 2, and so on. Here is what this looks like: 
...........*...........
..........***..........
.........*****.........

For the non-star characters, use dot or space.

Hint:
Each row of the picture has three parts: the first line of dots, the line of stars, the last line of dots. The three inside for-loops deal with each of these parts. Before they start, the number of characters each inside loop must output is calculated.
